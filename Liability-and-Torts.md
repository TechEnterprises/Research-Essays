Tort law is a branch of law that deals with civil wrongs, or wrongs that are committed against individuals or organizations, rather than crimes. Liability in tort law refers to the legal responsibility that one party has to another for any damages or injuries that they may cause. Liability may be based on a variety of different legal theories, such as negligence, strict liability, or intentional wrongdoing.

Negligence is a type of tort liability that is based on the idea that people have a duty to act with reasonable care in order to prevent harm to others. If someone fails to act with reasonable care and someone is injured as a result, that person may be held liable for the injuries.

Strict liability is a type of liability that does not require the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was negligent. Instead, the plaintiff only needs to show that the defendant was responsible for the harm that was caused. This type of liability is often used in cases involving dangerous products or activities.

Intentional torts are those that are committed intentionally, with the intention of causing harm to another person. Examples of intentional torts include battery, assault, and false imprisonment.

In a tort lawsuit, the person or organization that is found to be liable (or at fault) may be required to pay damages to the person who was injured or suffered a loss. These damages may be awarded to compensate the victim for their injuries, or to punish the defendant for their wrongdoing.
