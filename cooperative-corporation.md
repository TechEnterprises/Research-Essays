A cooperative corporation, also known as a co-op, is a type of business entity that is owned and controlled by its members, who are also the customers or workers of the co-op. Co-ops are based on the principles of cooperation, democracy, and equity, and their primary goal is to meet the needs and aspirations of their members rather than maximizing profits for external shareholders. Co-ops can take many forms, including worker co-ops, consumer co-ops, producer co-ops, and hybrid co-ops, and they can operate in various sectors, such as agriculture, finance, housing, and retail. Co-ops are often organized as non-profit organizations, but they can also be organized as for-profit businesses. The specific governance and management structures of co-ops vary depending on their type and size, but they typically involve a board of directors elected by the members and a system of member participation and control.
