A trademark is a symbol, word, or phrase that is used to identify and distinguish the goods or services of one company from those of another. In the United States, trademarks are regulated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To register a trademark in the US, the applicant must file a trademark application with the USPTO, and the trademark must be approved by the USPTO before it can be registered.

Trademarks are also recognized and protected in other countries around the world. Most countries have their own trademark laws and systems for registering trademarks. Some countries are members of international treaties that provide for the protection of trademarks in multiple countries. For example, the Madrid Protocol is an international treaty that allows companies to seek trademark protection in multiple countries by filing a single application with a central international office. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) administers the Madrid Protocol.

It is important for companies to protect their trademarks in other countries where they do business, as trademarks are an important way for companies to protect their brand and maintain the value of their products or services.
