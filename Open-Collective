OpenCollective is a platform for transparent and collaborative funding of open-source projects and communities. It allows individuals and organizations to financially support open-source projects and communities through recurring or one-time contributions.

The platform enables open-source project maintainers to create a funding page for their project, where they can provide information about the project and its goals, and accept contributions from supporters. Supporters can make contributions using a variety of payment methods, and can choose to make a one-time contribution or a recurring contribution.

OpenCollective also provides a number of other features to help open-source projects and communities manage their funding and finances, including:

Budgeting and expense tracking: Project maintainers can create budgets for their projects and track expenses, making it easy to see how funds are being used.
Transparent financial reporting: Project maintainers can share financial reports with their supporters, providing transparency and accountability.
Collective management: Organizations can create collectives to manage funding for multiple projects and communities.
The platform is designed to be an alternative to traditional funding models, such as venture capital, that are not well-suited to open-source projects and communities. OpenCollective aims to empower open-source maintainers and communities by providing them with a sustainable and transparent way to fund their work.
