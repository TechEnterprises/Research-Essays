Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is commonly used for formatting text on the web. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and it uses simple, plain-text syntax to format text as headings, lists, bold and italic text, and links.

Here is a list of some common Markdown syntax:

#: A single # symbol is used to create a level-1 heading. More # symbols can be used to create deeper headings, such as ## for a level-2 heading, ### for a level-3 heading, and so on.

*, -, +: These symbols are used to create unordered lists. For example:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
1., 2., 3.: These symbols are used to create ordered lists. For example:

Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
**: Text wrapped in double asterisks (**) is displayed as bold. For example: **This text will be bold**

*: Text wrapped in single asterisks (*) is displayed as italic. For example: *This text will be italic*

[Link text](URL): This syntax is used to create a hyperlink. For example: [Google](https://www.google.com)

![Alt text](Image URL): This syntax is used to insert an image. The "alt text" is displayed if the image can't be shown for some reason. For example: ![A cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg)

These are just a few examples of the many features of Markdown. For a complete reference, you may want to consult the original Markdown specification or other online resources.
