A patent is a form of intellectual property protection that gives the holder the exclusive right to make, use, and sell an invention for a certain period of time. In the United States, patents are granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To receive a patent, an inventor must apply for a patent and have their invention approved by the USPTO.

There are three main types of patents: utility patents, which cover new and useful inventions or discoveries; design patents, which cover new, original, and ornamental designs for an article of manufacture; and plant patents, which cover new varieties of plants that have been asexually reproduced.

To be eligible for a patent, an invention must be novel, non-obvious, and useful. The invention must also be fully and clearly described in the patent application, so that someone skilled in the relevant field can understand how to make and use the invention.

Patents provide inventors with the exclusive right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or importing their invention without their permission. This exclusivity can be a powerful incentive for inventors, as it allows them to recoup their investment in the invention and potentially profit from it. However, obtaining a patent can be a complex and costly process, and there are many legal requirements that must be met in order to obtain a patent.
