Copyright is a form of intellectual property protection that grants exclusive rights to the creator of a work for a certain period of time. In the United States, copyright law is governed by the Copyright Act of 1976, which grants copyright protection to original works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible form of expression, such as a book, song, or film.

Copyright protection applies to a wide range of creative works, including literature, music, art, photography, film, and software. It gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to reproduce the work, distribute copies, and create derivative works based on the original work.

To receive copyright protection, a work must be original and fixed in a tangible form. This means that it must be the product of the creator's own creative efforts and not simply copied from another source. Once a work is fixed in a tangible form, it is automatically protected by copyright, regardless of whether it is registered with the Copyright Office or carries a copyright notice.

However, registering a work with the Copyright Office and including a copyright notice on the work can provide additional legal protection and make it easier to enforce your rights if someone infringes on your copyright.
