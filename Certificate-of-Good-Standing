A certificate of good standing, also known as a certificate of existence or certificate of compliance, is a document issued by the secretary of state (or equivalent agency) that certifies that a business entity is in compliance with all state laws and regulations and is authorized to conduct business within the state.

The certificate verifies that the business entity is up-to-date on all required filings, such as annual reports and taxes, and has not been dissolved or revoked by the state. It also confirms that the business entity is in good standing with the state and is authorized to conduct business.

A certificate of good standing is often required when a business is applying for loans, contracts, or licenses, and when it is doing business with other states or countries. Some states require that a certificate of good standing be filed with the annual report.

The process for obtaining a certificate of good standing varies by state, but generally, it can be obtained by submitting a request to the secretary of state's office, along with any applicable fees. Some states allow you to order it online, others require mail or in-person visit.

It's important to note that a certificate of good standing is a snapshot in time, the certificate is only valid for the date it was issued, which means the business could go out of good standing with the state after the certificate was issued.
