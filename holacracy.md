In holacracy, authority is decentralized and decision-making is distributed throughout the organization, rather than being held by a single person or group at the top of the hierarchy. Roles are defined in governance records and are designed to clearly articulate the work that needs to be done and the expectations for how that work will be carried out. Each role has specific responsibilities and authorities that are defined in the governance records, and individuals who hold a particular role are accountable for fulfilling those responsibilities.

It is important to note that holacracy is not a rigid system, and it allows for flexibility and adaptability within an organization. While there are no traditional "bosses" in holacracy, individuals who hold certain roles may have more decision-making power or influence within the organization due to the responsibilities and authorities associated with their roles.

Holacracy is a governance and management system for organizations that aims to provide a clear and effective way to manage complex work and decision-making processes. It is designed to help organizations become more agile, responsive, and innovative by decentralizing decision-making and empowering individuals and teams to take ownership of their work. 

In a holacratic organization, decision-making is distributed throughout the organization, rather than being centralized at the top. This means that individuals and teams are empowered to make decisions about their work, rather than having to wait for approval from higher-ups. 

Holacracy is based on a set of principles and practices that are designed to help organizations manage complexity, adapt to change, and foster collaboration and innovation. It is implemented through a series of meetings and roles that are designed to help teams and individuals clarify their roles and responsibilities, set clear goals and priorities, and track progress. 

### Holacratic organizations often use a combination of face-to-face meetings and digital tools to support communication and collaboration. Some of the key elements of a holacratic organization include: 

Roles: In holacracy, roles are defined based on the work that needs to be done, rather than the people who are doing it. Roles are defined in terms of the outcomes that need to be achieved, the accountabilities that come with the role, and the authority that is required to get the work done. 

Circles: In holacracy, teams are organized into circles, which are self-managing groups that are responsible for a specific area of work. Each circle has a clear purpose, defined roles, and governance structures that are designed to support collaboration and decision-making. 

Governance meetings: Holacratic organizations use governance meetings to make decisions about the direction and priorities of the organization. These meetings are typically attended by the representatives of each circle, and decisions are made using a set of agreed-upon governance processes. 

Tactical meetings: Holacratic organizations also use tactical meetings to coordinate the work of individual circles and teams. These meetings are typically attended by the members of each circle and are used to plan and coordinate the work that needs to be done. 

## Circle

In holacracy, a circle is a self-managing group of individuals who are responsible for a specific area of work within an organization. The members of a circle typically include those who are directly responsible for the work that needs to be done, as well as any other stakeholders who need to be involved in decision-making or have an impact on the work of the circle. 

The specific people needed to create a circle will depend on the nature of the work that needs to be done and the stakeholders who are involved. Some of the key factors to consider when determining who should be included in a circle might include: 

The roles and responsibilities of each person: In holacracy, roles are defined based on the work that needs to be done, rather than the people who are doing it. As such, it is important to ensure that the people who are included in the circle have the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to carry out the work that is required. 

The impact of the work on other parts of the organization: It is also important to consider the impact that the work of the circle may have on other parts of the organization, and to ensure that any stakeholders who may be affected by the work of the circle are included in the decision-making process. 

The decision-making authority needed: The people who are included in a circle should have the authority to make decisions about the work that needs to be done, as well as the resources that are needed to get the work done. 

Ultimately, the specific people who are needed to create a circle will depend on the nature of the work that needs to be done and the stakeholders who are involved. It is important to ensure that the circle is properly staffed with the right mix of people to ensure that the work can be effectively managed and accomplished. 

In holacracy, the lead link is typically responsible for guiding and supporting the work of a particular role or team within an organization. However, there are other roles and structures in holacracy that also play a role in supporting and coordinating the work of teams and roles within the organization. 

## Governance

Governance itself is organized by a circle, which is responsible for setting the overall direction and strategy of the organization. The governance circle is made up of representatives from each of the different circles within the organization and is responsible for defining the roles and responsibilities of each circle, as well as for setting the overall operating principles and values of the organization. The governance circle is led by a governance lead, who is responsible for facilitating the work of the governance circle and ensuring that it is aligned with the overall mission and vision of the organization. 

Overall, there are various roles and structures in holacracy that are responsible for supporting and coordinating the work of teams and roles within the organization, and for ensuring that the organization is aligned with its overall mission and goals. 
 
### Holacracy can be applied to a collectively owned tech business incubator in a number of ways. Some possible ways that holacracy could be implemented in this context include: 

Defining roles and responsibilities: Holacracy can be used to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each team within the incubator, as well as the relationships between different roles and teams. This can help to ensure that everyone knows what is expected of them and how they fit into the overall organization. 

Setting goals and objectives: Holacracy can be used to set clear goals and objectives for each role and team within the incubator, and to track progress towards those goals. This can help to ensure that the incubator is focused on achieving its overall mission and vision. 

Facilitating decision-making: Holacracy can be used to establish a clear and transparent decision-making process, which can help to ensure that decisions are made in a collaborative and inclusive manner. 

Managing resources: Holacracy can be used to manage resources such as budgets, personnel, and facilities in a more effective and efficient manner, which can help to ensure that the incubator is able to support the growth and success of the businesses it incubates. 

Overall, holacracy can be a useful tool for a collectively owned tech business incubator to help it operate in a more transparent, efficient, and effective manner, and to achieve its overall mission and goals.
