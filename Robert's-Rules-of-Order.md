Robert's Rules of Order is a parliamentary procedure that is used to conduct meetings and make decisions as efficiently and fairly as possible. It was first published in 1876 by Henry M. Robert, and has since become the most widely used parliamentary authority in the United States. The rules are designed to help organizations make decisions by ensuring that all members have the opportunity to participate and that the minority is protected. They are based on the concept of majority rule, but also provide guidelines for how to protect the rights of the minority and ensure that everyone has a fair chance to be heard. The rules are often used in meetings of clubs, associations, and other groups to ensure that meetings are run smoothly and efficiently.
